# Longhorn - Cloud-native Block Storage

This is a very generic installation... once installed (see deploy.sh) then you just need to use the UI to set up new storage paths on each node where applicable (enable scheduling on the new path and then disable on the old). At the moment, this is the only customization used (values.yaml is just kept in case it is needed later).
